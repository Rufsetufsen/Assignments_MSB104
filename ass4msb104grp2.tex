\section{Assignment 4 Consolidation of Key
findings}\label{assignment-4-consolidation-of-key-findings}

\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\subsubsection{Background}\label{background}

Regional development in Europe is uneven, not just between the different
national economies but within the regions themselves. Many NUTS2 regions
contain both strong and weak local economies, and the internal spread of
GDP can be wide. These internal differences influence local labour
markets, municipal finances, service provision, and long-term
opportunities for residents. At the same time, regional inequality is
often discussed at the national level, even though the more practical
challenges, uneven access to jobs, productivity gaps, and infrastructure
differences, play out inside regions. Understanding what drives internal
regional GDP disparities is therefore important for anyone trying to
make territorial development more balanced.

\subsubsection{Objectives}\label{objectives}

Assignments 1, 2, and 3 focused on different parts of this problem.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Assignment 1} built the dataset: collecting GDP, population,
  unemployment, and information at the NUTS2 level, and calculated the
  intra-regional GDP inequality using a population-weighted Gini
  coefficient.
\item
  \textbf{Assignment 2} analysed a cross-section of the year 2017 to see
  whether regional development, measured as GDP per capita growth, is
  linked to internal GDP inequality. It also looked at whether this
  relationship differs across different segments of population density,
  workforce size, and unemployment rates.
\item
  \textbf{Assignment 3} extended the analysis to a full panel,
  estimating fixed-effects models to test whether the
  development--inequality relationship holds once we control for
  time-invariant regional characteristics and common yearly shocks. We
  also evaluated alternative functional forms and ran diagnostic tests
  to check model robustness.
\end{itemize}

Across all three assignments, the overarching research question has been
the same: \textbf{\emph{Does faster regional development lead to more
balanced internal GDP distribution?}}

\subsubsection{Significance}\label{significance}

This topic is relevant because internal regional disparities affect
everyday economic conditions more directly than national averages. When
only a few municipalities drive most of a region's GDP, the surrounding
areas may face weaker labour markets, lower tax bases, and fewer
opportunities due to the ``economic field of gravity'' of the dominating
region centralizing economic activity towards itself, even if the region
as a whole looks like it performs well.\\
Policymakers may then assume that economic growth alone may ``spill
over'' (or ``trickle down'', if you will) and reduce these gaps. Our
work tests that assumption with comparable data across four European
countries. By combining cross-sectional, segmented, and fixed-effects
panel approaches, the study provides a clearer view of whether
short-term development actually improves internal regional balance, or
whether structural characteristics dominate the pattern. This helps
clarify where growth policies are sufficient, and where more targeted,
place-based strategies are needed.

\subsection{Literature Review -
Kristoffer}\label{literature-review---kristoffer}

\subsubsection{Previous Work}\label{previous-work}

A central reference point for our work is Lessmann \& Seidel (2017), who
shows that the link between economic development and regional inequality
is not linear. Their results suggest something closer to an inverted-U
(and in some cases N-shaped) pattern, where inequality tends to rise in
the middle stages of development before falling again in high-income
settings. This gives a natural expectation that fast-growing regions may
show lower inequality if they are already relatively advanced, while
poorer or developing regions might move in the opposite direction. Their
work is also relevant because they rely on both traditional data and
satellite-based luminosity data, which shows that inequality can be
meaningfully captured even when official data is patchy --- a recurring
issue even in Eurostat datasets, as we experienced directly.

Eurostat's own methodological documentation is also part of the relevant
background. Their notes on missing values help explain why regional GDP
and population numbers are incomplete in certain years. These gaps arise
from reclassification of regions, confidentiality rules, or delayed
reporting. Understanding why these ``quirks'' happen is important
because it directly affects our results.

For our segmentation work, we also build on Eurostat's definitions of
population-density classes used for identifying rural areas, urban
clusters, and high-density urban centres. While Eurostat's approach
operates at the 1 km² continuous grid-cell level, their breakpoints (300
and 1500 people per square kilometer) give a practical structure for
grouping NUTS2 regions by density. This matters because urban density is
often correlated with both productivity and access to public-services,
and therefore a likely influence when it comes to regional GDP
inequality.

\subsubsection{Research Gap}\label{research-gap}

While there is existing literature on national GDP inequality trends and
on broader development patterns, there is less focus on how short-term
growth shocks play out inside individual NUTS2 regions, and even less on
whether the effect of growth differs across structural categories like
urban density, unemployment rates, or workforce size. Our assignments
aim to examine exactly that: to see whether any of these structural
categories influence GDP inequality in NUTS2-regions, and if so, to what
degree.

\subsection{Data and Methodology}\label{data-and-methodology}

\subsubsection{Data Sources - Harald}\label{data-sources---harald}

Primary data refers to information collected firsthand by the researcher
directly from original source. It is raw and unprocessed, typically
gathered through methods such as surveys, interviews and observations.
The data provided by Eurostat can be considered primary data because it
is originally collected through official surveys and processed following
established methodological standards for gathering information on
specific topic within defined time periods.

In the first assignment, we used Eurostat to extract datasets on gross
domestic product (GDP) at current market prices by NUTS 3 regions, with
the datacode: nama\_10r\_3gdp and population on 1 january by broard age
group, sex and NUTS 3 region, with the datacode: demo\_r\_pjanaggr3.
From these datasets, we collected data for Germany, Ireland, Croatia
annd Switzerland covering the years 2000 to 2023.

In the second assignment, we retrieved data from three additional
datasets that could potentially influence regional inequality in 2017.
These datasets included labour force by NUTS 2 region with the datacode:
lfst\_r\_lfp2act, unemployment rate by Nuts 2 region with the data code:
tgs00010, and population density by NUTS 2 region with the data code:
tgs00024 . Each country collects its own data and reports it to Eurostat
in accordance with ESA 2010, a global framework for national accounting.
This ensures that the resulting statistics are consistent, reliable, and
comparable across countries.

However, the data also comes with certain limitations. For example,
Switzerland is not en EU member but an EFTA country (European Free Trade
Association), which promotes free trade and economic cooperation.
Because Switzerland did not have a formal datasharing agreement with
Eurostate before 2008, some data for earlier years or specific topics
may be missing (\emph{Information on Data - National Accounts -
Eurostat}, n.d.).

Another limitation relates to confidentiality. Ireland, for instance,
lacks GDP data for 2015-2017 in the Mid-West and South-West regions due
to confidentiality restrictions imposed by Ireland's Central Statistics
Office. These restrictions are linked to changes in the national
accounts in 2015 that significantly affected the measurement of
Ireland's productive capacity (\emph{County Incomes and Regional GDP
2015 - CSO - Central Statistics Office}, 2018).

Some counters also choose to delay the publication of certain statistics
to ensure accuracy. As a result, data for the most recent years of 2022
and 2023, may still be incomplete due to its unavailability.

A common limitation across several datasets concerns changes in regional
boundaries. Regions may merge to form larger areas or split into smaller
units, affecting how data is collected, aggregated and updated. This
issue is particularly relevant in Germany, where regional reforms occur
more frequntly due to regional policy. Coratia and Ireland face similar
challenges, as changes to their NUTS regions have affected population
data availability at the NUTS 3 level.

Finally, there were limitations related to the time coverage of the
datasets. Althought the assignments aimed to examine data from 2000 to
2023, the population density dataset for NUTS 2 regions only covers
2012-2023, and the unemployment rate dataset covers 2013-2023.
Consequently, when including these variables, we were restricted to
using data from 2013 to 2023 to maintain consistency across datasets.

\subsubsection{Methodological approach -
Kristoffer}\label{methodological-approach---kristoffer}

\paragraph{Cross-Sectional Estimation}\label{cross-sectional-estimation}

We first combined the Eurostat datasets covering GDP (in million euros)
and population, , then calculated GDP per capita and Gini coefficients
using a formula weighted by population, like Lessmann \& Seidel (2017).
We then visualized the calculated Gini coefficients for the different
regions using different plots from ggplot2. In assignment 2, we made a
cross-sectional analysis of the year 2017 using a regression model to
test the effect of change in regional GDP per capita on regional
inequality. We specified the following linear regression model: \[
\text{Gini}_{i,2017} = \alpha + \beta \, \Delta \text{GDPpc}_{i,2016 \to 2017} + u_i
\] Where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\text{Gini}_{i,2017}\) --- Calculated Gini coefficient of region
  \emph{i} in 2017 (regional GDP per capita inequality)\\
\item
  \(\Delta \text{GDPpc}_{i,2016 \to 2017}\) --- percent change in GDP
  per capita from 2016 to 2017 in region \emph{i}\\
\item
  \(\alpha\) --- intercept term (baseline inequality when GDP-per-capita
  change is zero)\\
\item
  \(\beta\) --- slope coefficient showing how inequality changes with a
  one-percentage-point increase in GDP-per-capita growth\\
\item
  \(u_i\) --- error term capturing unobserved regional factors
\end{itemize}

We then experimented with other determinants of inequality by making a
new OLS model with a set of new variables: population density (persons
per square kilometer), unemployment rate and total workforce, also
fetched from Eurostat. We specified the MLR as follows: \[
\text{Gini}_{i,2017} = \alpha + \beta_1\,\text{Workforce}_i + \beta_2\,\text{PopDensity}_i + \beta_3\,\text{Unemployment}_i + u_i\]

where \(\alpha\) is the intercept, \(\beta_1\), \(\beta_2\), and
\(\beta_3\) are the slope coefficients for each explanatory variable,
and \(u_i\) is the error term capturing unobserved factors affecting
inequality.

\paragraph{Segmentation}\label{segmentation}

We also segmented regions into categories to examine if the
development--inequality relationship differed across different
structural environments. Population density was split into ``Rural'',
``Medium Density'', and ``High Density'' using Eurostat-inspired
breakpoints (0--300, 300--1500, 1500+). For workforce size, we used
quantile-based grouping (Low, Medium, High). Unemployment rate was also
split into Low-High segments, but here we set the breakpoints manually
at 0\%-5\%, 5\%-10\% and 10+\%. These subsets were used to run separate
regressions for each group.

\paragraph{Panel Estimation}\label{panel-estimation}

Finally, we estimated fixed-effects models using the full panel,
applying plm() with region, country, year, and two-way effects. Before
estimation, we converted the dataset into a pdata.frame and cleaned
remaining NA/Inf values to avoid dropped regions. The panel models
allowed us to control for all time-invariant regional characteristics,
giving a ``less noisy'' picture of how regional GDP inequality changes
inside regions over time.

\paragraph{Handling of NA-values and
Heteroskedasticity}\label{handling-of-na-values-and-heteroskedasticity}

After joining the datasets onto eachother, including the new variables
used for segmenting, we ended up with a few obvious gaps in our data and
some NA/Inf rows. These were removed to keep the panel consistent, but a
side effect of this is that we only have panel data from 2013 onwards.

We also ran Breusch--Pagan tests to check for heteroskedasticity across
all regressions. Where alternative functional forms were required, we
introduced quadratic and logarithmic transformations of the key
variables and evaluated their residual behaviour the same way.

\subsection{Empirical Findings -
Harald}\label{empirical-findings---harald}

\subsubsection{Cross- sectional
Estimates}\label{cross--sectional-estimates}

In assignment 2, we began with a cross-sectional analysis examining the
relationship between regional inequality and short-term ecnonmic
development, measured as the change in GDP per capita from 2016 to 2017.
The dependent variable in our model was regional inequality, measured by
the Gini coefficent, and the independent variable was the change in GDP
per capita: \[
\text{Gini}_{i,2017} = \alpha + \beta \, \Delta \text{GDPpc}_{i,2016 \to 2017} + u_i\]

From the linear regression model we get the results:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When change gdp per capita growth is zero, the regional inequality
  coefficient is estimated \(\hat{\alpha}=0.134\).
\item
  Change in GDP per capita growth has a coefficient of
  \(\hat{\beta}=-0.002\) (p=0.435), indicating it is not statistically
  significant.
\item
  Overall, the model's explanatory power is very low: \(R^2 = 0.012\),
  adjusted \(R^2 = -0.008\), and the F-test (F = 0.619, p = 0.435)
  suggests the model is not statistically significant.
\end{itemize}

Thus, although the coefficient suggests a negative relationship, the
effect is statistically insignificant and not substantively meaningful.

We then went on to collect three more variables to determine whether
they serve as strong predictor of regional inequality then
GDP-per-capita growth. These variables were labour force, unemployment
rate, and population density. After cleaning and tiding the data, we
estimated a multiple regression model to analyse their cross-sectional
relationship with inequality: \[
\text{Gini}_{i,2017} = \alpha + \beta_1\,\text{Workforce}_i + \beta_2\,\text{PopDensity}_i + \beta_3\,\text{Unemployment}_i + u_i\]

Running the regression model gave us the following estimates:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When all independent variables are zero, the regional inequality
  coefficient is estimated at \(\beta = 0.150\) (p \textless{} 0.001).
\item
  Workforce has a coefficient of \(\beta = 0.000043\) (p = 0.0216),
  statistically significant at the 5\% level, indicating that regional
  inequality increases slightly as the labour force grows by one
  thousand workers.
\item
  Population density (Pop\_km²) has a coefficient of
  \(\beta = -0.000041\) (p = 0.0083), statistically significant at the
  1\% level, suggesting that more densely populated regions tend to have
  lower inequality.
\item
  Unemployment (Unemp\_prct) has a coefficient of \(\beta = -0.0114\) (p
  = 0.0613), marginally significant at the 10\% level, indicating a weak
  negative relationship with inequality.
\item
  Overall, the model's explanatory power is moderate: \(R^2 = 0.283\),
  adjusted \(R^2 = 0.235\), and the F-test (F = 5.908, p = 0.0017)
  indicates the model is statistically significant. Structural variables
  such as workforce size and population density better capture regional
  economic differences than short-term GDP-per-capita growth.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Alternative functional forms and panel
estimates}\label{alternative-functional-forms-and-panel-estimates}

In this section, we explored alternative functional forms of the
regression models using the variables from the second assignment
workforce, population density, and unemployment rate to examine their
effects on regional inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient.
Specifically, we considered linear, logarithmic, and quadratic
functional forms. While cubic specifications were also tested, they
produced more estimates without providing meaningful improvements in
explanatory power, so they were not pursued further.

We constructed separate regression tables for each functional form
linear, logarithmic, and quadraticand compared their performance in
terms of coefficient significance, explanatory power, and overall model
fit. Below, we summarize the key findings and interpret the effects of
each independent variable.

Workforce

Linear model:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  When all independent variables are zero, the regional inequality
  coefficient is estimated at \(\beta = 0.1773\).
\item
  Workforce has a coefficient of \(\beta = 0.000036\) (p = 0.0665),
  which is marginally significant at the 10\% level.
\item
  Change in GDP per capita has a coefficient of \(\beta = -0.002122\) (p
  = 0.4931), indicating it is not statistically significant.
\item
  Overall, the model's explanatory power is low: \(R^2 = 0.074\),
  adjusted \(R^2 = 0.035\), and the F-test (F = 1.877, p = 0.163)
  suggests the model is not statistically significant.
\end{itemize}

Logarithmic model:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Transforming change in GDP per capita using a log transformation
  improves model performance.
\item
  When all independent variables are zero, the regional inequality
  coefficient is estimated at \(\beta = 0.0.2292\).
\item
  The coefficient for GDP per capita becomes \(\beta = -0.059611\) and
  is highly significant (p = 0.0008), showing a negative relationship
  with the Gini coefficient.
\item
  Workforce remains largely unchanged at \(\beta = 0.000033\) (p =
  0.0604, marginally significant).
\item
  Explanatory power improves: \(R^2 = 0.288\), adjusted
  \(R^2 = 0.0251\), and the F-test is highly significant (F = 8.078, p =
  0.0011).
\end{itemize}

Quadratic model:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The quadratic specification produces less significant results than the
  logarithmic model.
\item
  When all independent variables are zero, the regional inequality
  coefficient is estimated at \(\beta = 0.1379\).
\item
  GDP per capita: linear term \(\beta = 0.004327\) (p = 0.4066),
  quadratic term \(\beta = -0.000468\) (p = 0.1302), both insignificant.
\item
  Workforce: \(\beta = 0.000029\) (p = 0.1480), effect is weak.
\item
  \(R^2 = 0.1194\), adjusted \(R^2 = 0.06199\), and the model is not
  statistically significant overall (p = 0.116).
\end{itemize}

Summary: The logarithmic model best captures the relationship between
workforce, GDP growth, and inequality, mainly due to the strong
significance of log-transformed GDP per capita.

Summary: The logarithmic transformation of GDP per capita produces the
strongest model for unemployment, improving both explanatory power and
overall significance. Unemployment shows a weak but negative
relationship with inequality, while quadratic effects of GDP per capita
are borderline significant.

Overall Conclusion for the alternative functional forms:

Across all variables, logarithmic models generally provide the best
explanatory power and statistical significance, particularly through the
transformation of GDP per capita. Quadratic models capture some
non-linear effects but often at the cost of reduced overall
significance. Linear models are generally the weakest in explaining
regional inequality. The key takeaway is that GDP per capita growth
consistently shows a negative relationship with inequality when
appropriately transformed, while workforce, population density, and
unemployment rate exhibit more nuanced, context-dependent effects.

The panel regression results reveal a consistently positive association
between change in GDP per capita and the dependent variable across all
specifications. The magnitude of the effect is small (0.00017--0.00024),
but precision improves substantially when controlling for regional
heterogeneity using NUTS2 fixed effects, as reflected in markedly lower
standard errors and RMSE. Models with country only or year only fixed
effects explain very little variation (R² = 0.005--0.009), whereas NUTS2
and NUTS2 \& Year fixed effects substantially improve model fit (R² =
0.102--0.109) and are preferred according to AIC and BIC. These findings
highlight the importance of accounting for subnational regional
characteristics, which capture significant variation in the outcome
variable. Overall, the results suggest that regional-level factors are
key drivers of the dependent variable, while the positive effect of
change in GDP per capita remains robust across specifications.

\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion}

The initial model examining the effect of change in GDP per capita on
regional inequality shows very weak explanatory capacity. The model's
F-test yields a p-value of 0.435, indicating that the relationship is
statistically insignificant, and the multiple R² of 1.2\% demonstrates
that GDP per capita growth accounts for almost none of the variation in
inequality. The estimated coefficient is negative (β = --0.002), but its
magnitude is negligible, and it fails to reach significance. This
suggests that short-term economic growth on its own does not
meaningfully explain differences in regional inequality.

When additional variables such as labour force, population density, and
unemployment rate are included, the explanatory power improves
substantially. The multiple R² increases to 0.2826, with an adjusted R²
of 0.2357, indicating that these factors together account for 23--28\%
of the variation in regional inequality. Each predictor contributes
differently: workforce is significant at the 5\% level (p = 0.0216),
population density at the 1\% level (p = 0.0083), and unemployment is
marginally significant at the 10\% level (p = 0.0613). The coefficients
indicate a small positive association for workforce (β = 0.000043),
while population density (β = --0.000041) and unemployment (β =
--0.0114) gives a negative relationships with inequality. These patterns
suggest that regions with larger labour forces may experience slightly
higher inequality, whereas denser regions tend to show lower inequality,
and higher unemployment appears to compress income distribution. The
estimated value of regional inequality (β = 0.150168) cannot be
meaningfully interpreted, as no region can give a zero value for any of
the three predictors.

Exploring alternative functional forms provides insight into how
workforce size, population density, and unemployment rate affect
regional inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient.

In the workforce models, the linear specification estimates the
intercept at β = 0.1773, indicating the baseline level of inequality
when all predictors are zero. Workforce has a small positive coefficient
(β = 0.000036, p = 0.0665), marginally significant at the 10\% level.
This suggests that for every additional unit of workforce, such as an
extra thousand workers, the regional Gini coefficient increases by
0.000036, representing a very slight rise in inequality. GDP per capita
growth in the linear model is insignificant (β = --0.002122, p =
0.4931), and overall explanatory power is low (R² = 0.074, adjusted R² =
0.035; F = 1.877, p = 0.163).

The logarithmic specification improves the model substantially. The
intercept increases to β = 0.2292, and log-transformed GDP per capita
becomes highly significant (β = --0.059611, p = 0.0008), indicating that
proportional increases in GDP per capita are associated with reductions
in inequality. Workforce remains marginally significant (β = 0.000033, p
= 0.0604), implying that a one-unit increase still slightly raises
inequality, but the effect is very small relative to the impact of GDP
growth. Explanatory power rises to R² = 0.288, adjusted R² = 0.251, with
an F-test of 8.078 (p = 0.0011). The quadratic model reduces
significance: GDP linear (β = 0.004327, p = 0.4066) and quadratic terms
(β = --0.000468, p = 0.1302) are insignificant, workforce becomes weaker
(β = 0.000029, p = 0.1480), and overall model fit is low (R² = 0.1194,
adjusted R² = 0.06199, p = 0.116).

For population density, the linear model estimates the intercept at β =
0.1506, with population density negatively associated with inequality (β
= --0.000037, p = 0.0228). A one-unit increase in population density
(e.g., one person per square kilometer) decreases the Gini coefficient
by 0.000037, indicating slightly lower inequality in denser regions. GDP
per capita is insignificant (β = 0.000054, p = 0.6166), and model fit is
modest (R² = 0.111, adjusted R² = 0.072; F = 7.36, p = 0.00668). The
logarithmic model strengthens the relationships: intercept rises to β =
0.229228, log GDP per capita is highly significant and negative (β =
--0.05793, p = 0.0007), and population density remains negative and
significant (β = --0.000039, p = 0.0047). Explanatory power increases
substantially (R² = 0.364, adjusted R² = 0.331, F-test p = 0.0001). The
quadratic model introduces a significant squared GDP term (β =
--0.000682, p = 0.0198) while the linear term is not significant (β =
0.0077, p = 0.1136), and population density remains negative (β =
--0.000041, p = 0.0091). Model fit is moderate (R² = 0.213, adjusted R²
= 0.161, p = 0.0123), showing some curvature but weaker explanatory
power than the logarithmic specification.

In the unemployment models, the linear specification estimates the
intercept at β = 0.1758, with unemployment negatively associated with
inequality (β = --0.001039, p = 0.03). A one-percentage-point increase
in unemployment reduces the Gini coefficient by 0.001039, indicating a
slight compression of inequality. GDP per capita remains insignificant
(β = --0.0000248, p = 0.936), and model fit is low (R² = 0.10, adjusted
R² = 0.062, F-test p = 0.083). The logarithmic model improves
performance: intercept rises to β = 0.233016, log GDP per capita is
significant and negative (β = --0.051, p = 0.005), and unemployment
becomes insignificant (β = --0.00707, p = 0.1096). Model fit increases
(R² = 0.27, adjusted R² = 0.2336, F-test p = 0.0018). The quadratic
model shows borderline significance for unemployment (β = --0.009216, p
= 0.0516) and the squared GDP term (β = --0.000488, p = 0.0102), with
lower explanatory power (R² = 0.1517, adjusted R² = 0.09633, F-test p =
0.0539).

Overall, these results show that a one-unit increase in workforce
slightly raises inequality, higher population density slightly reduces
inequality, and higher unemployment slightly reduces inequality, while
log-transformed GDP per capita consistently reduces inequality across
the models. The magnitude of the GDP effect is much larger than the
other predictors, highlighting that proportional economic growth has a
stronger association with regional inequality than the small incremental
effects of workforce, population density, or unemployment.

The panel regression results add further nuance. Across specifications,
the estimated effect of change in GDP per capita is consistently
positive, with coefficients ranging from 0.00017 to 0.00024, though
these effects are small. The level of statistical precision improves
markedly when regional heterogeneity is controlled using NUTS2 fixed
effects. Models with only country or year fixed effects explain very
little variation (R² = 0.005--0.009), while those incorporating NUTS2
fixed effects achieve considerably higher explanatory power (R² =
0.102--0.109) and lower RMSE. The improvements in information criteria
(AIC and BIC) further indicate that regional characteristics play an
important role in shaping inequality outcomes.

Throughout these results, the differences in functional form,
particularly the impact of logarithmic versus linear specifications
demonstrate how sensitive the estimated relationships are to model
structure. Transformations applied to GDP per capita growth consistently
produce stronger, clearer relationships with inequality, while the
effects of workforce size, population density, and unemployment vary
considerably depending on the specification used.

\subsubsection{Key insights}\label{key-insights}

\subsubsection{Policy Implications}\label{policy-implications}

Across all the cross-sectional and panel models, the effect of GDP per
capita growth on inequality is small, unstable, and mostly
insignificant. For policymakers, this means that betting on regional
inequality improvements through ``more growth'' alone would be a
sub-optimal approach The differences between regions appear to be driven
far more by long-term structural characteristics than by year-to-year
economic performance.

The segmentation exercises support this interpretation, although with a
small asterisk attached. Regions with higher population density tend to
show slightly lower inequality, while rural regions display more
variation and, in some cases, higher inequality. This suggests that
sparsely populated areas face structural disadvantages---smaller labour
markets, fewer high-wage occupations, weaker public services---that
growth alone cannot compensate for. At the same time, the way
NUTS2-regions are defined (generally based on existing administrative
divisions), makes it so that we cannot take this at face value. This
division tends to separate city-regions into their own separate
NUTS2-regions, meaning that the most densely populated areas also by
definition have the least regional GDP inequality, seeing as they tend
to only consist of one region, and thus come out with a calculated Gini
of zero.

Regions with larger labour forces tend to show wider internal GDP
variation. This is consistent with regions that contain both highly
productive sub-areas and weaker ones. Policymakers in these regions may
need to invest specifically in connecting the smaller municipalities to
the dominant ``key region'' through commuting infrastructure, business
support, or coordinated urban planning.

The unemployment segmentation reinforces the point that ``low
disparities'' are not always a sign of strength. Regions with weaker
economic activity often show very low internal differences simply
because no municipality stands out as a strong performer. Policymakers
should avoid interpreting these cases as success stories and instead
view them as indicators of stagnation.

Finally, the panel results show that once we control for each region's
structural characteristics, the effect of growth on internal disparities
barely changes. The implication is: regional GDP inequality is mainly
driven by long-term spatial and economic structures, not by short-term
GDP growth. Effective policies therefore need to focus on durable
place-based strategies---strengthening urban centres, improving
connectivity, and reducing structural disadvantages---rather than
relying on general growth policies to equalise development inside
regions.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Research -
Harald}\label{limitations-and-future-research---harald}

Through the analyse of the datasets from the three assignments, several
limitations emerged. These most be acknowledged when one shall
interpreting the results. The first limitation and the most crucial one
is the limited data across the different Eurostat datasets which we
used. Some variables were not consistently reported for each country as
mentioned. These missing values gave us Na in our coding and was
challenging to form a fully comparable and comprehensive dataset. This
also crated uncertainty regarding which variables were most suitable for
capturing the specific characteristics of the countries included in the
study.

Another limitations is the knowledge of which variable would have the
greatest influence on regional inequalities, and how they will shape the
analysis. Without stronger evidence one variable impact, some
assumptions had to be made when selecting and interpreting the data.
Each countries followed a universe dictation on how to collect data for
Eurostat, but how the methods would be interpreted and executed across
each countries would further complicated comparisons, as each nation may
decipher the definitions, or reporting practices differently. These
inconsistencies can affect the reliability of cross-country analyses.

By gaining a deeper insight into the context of each country we have
been given and how they processes their collected data, we would have a
stronger interpretation of our results from the analyse. For a more
accuracy and improved analyse of regional dynamics, a more in-depth
understanding of data practices and how these variables affects the
countries would likely improve the workflow and understanding of the
results. This could help with future analyses and enhance the ability to
explain the variations in regional inequalities.
